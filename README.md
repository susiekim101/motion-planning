# CA3_nav_starter
The goal of this assignment is to test and modify different motion planning algorithms by designing, running, and interpreting experiments. 
By the end, you should have a concrete, experimental understanding of:
1. How EKF-SLAM behaves under different trajectories and noise conditions
2. How PRM and RRT compare as sampling-based mtion planners in the same environment
3. Simpl ways to improve PRM and RRT and when those improvements help.
